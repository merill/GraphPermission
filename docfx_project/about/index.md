While the [Microsoft Graph reference page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) provides a summary of all the permissions, it's not easy to find out the APIs and data that are made available when a consent is provided to an application.

This site will help you quickly get a list of all the APIs for a given Graph permission scope.

Please submit feedback and any issues [here](https://github.com/merill/graphpermissions.github.io/issues).
